## Job Application Test

This repository contains the solution to the coding test conducted as part of the job application process for Target Sistemas. The test involved developing a JavaScript function to reverse a given string without using any built-in methods and a JavaScript function to checks if a given number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence.

## Description

The test task required the implementation of one C and one Phython functions: `reverseString(str)` and `isFibonacci(number)`.

1. `reverseString(str)`: This function takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string without using any built-in string reversal functions. The function iterates over each character of the input string from the last character to the first character and concatenates them to build the reversed string. The solution is implemented in JavaScript.

2. `isFibonacci(number)`: This function checks if a given number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence. It iterates over the Fibonacci sequence, generating numbers until it reaches a number greater than or equal to the input number. If the input number is found in the sequence, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

## Test Completion

The test was successfully completed by developing both required functions and ensuring their correctness through testing with various input strings and numbers. The solutions adhere to the provided requirements and do not use any built-in string reversal methods or predefined Fibonacci sequence arrays.

This solution demonstrates proficiency in C and Phython programming and problem-solving skills.


## Repository Structure

- `reverseString.c`: C file containing the implementation of the `reverseString` function.
- `isFibonacci.py`: Phython file containing the implementation of the `isFibonacci` function.
